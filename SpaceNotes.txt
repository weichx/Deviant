 //Vector3 force = goalVelocity - rigidbody.velocity; this yields a really interesting corkscrew behavior, cool for evasion


 //todo it would be fun to have limited slide mode where velocity is totally unlock from ship rotation
        //this would mean that for a short time the ship could rotate independant of its velocity then would resume velocity alignment
        //this is a post v0.1 of the ai though
        //might be fun to have dynamic areodynamic values too

        //todo calculate turn radius based on speed
        //todo dynamic engine power
        //it could be fun to disconnect craft orientation from craft velocity for a short while
        
        //make ai smart bout what their craft can do, if it rolls quickly have it roll to target then pitch up, if it yaws have it bank normally
        

		try plotting a path around obstacles by taking the inital avoidance steering direction and advancing it n units (5ish?) and check if in 
		x = number of frames to reach point, then recompute a steering direction from there, continue until path to target is clear / reached target
		or ran out of frames (if limited)

How do I define a formation?
	By object reference -- that way formation specific properties can be collected
	A leader finding delegate can be optionally provided, otherwise take first item in alpha sorted entity id list
	A leader does not need to migrate to the leader slot, slot migration is a flag
	
Formation Properties
	Shape -- list of slots
	Size -- max units
	Type -- types of units?
	Tension -- how close units stick together
		
What do we do in a formation
	Attack Run
	Joust
	Patrol / Defend
	Exit / Warp / Enter Hanger
	Arrive / Exit Warp
	Coordinated Spline Maneuver
		
What interrupts a formation
	Enemy fire
	New Goal
	Evasion
	End of joust	
	
Shifting formation
	Flight Formation
	Attack Formation -- spread / shift for better firing angle w/o hitting friendlies
	Flair -- swap slots with someone
	Peel -- like a fighter plane, roll && drift		

Flying in formation
	Leader moves at slower pace while formation is collecting
	Leader takes turns at 80% turn radius of least agile formation element
	as formation elements align with formation node (tracked by dot and distance trend), increase their individual formation tension

Entering formation
	Ambient Goal -- when nothing is pressing, try to re-enter formation
	Scripted Goal
	Opportunistic -- when near a wing mate / ally request formation, spawns a temporary formation
				  -- with those units, collect units as it moves, defers
				  -- to actual formation if one is present and message goes out to enter it. 
				  -- this might happen during an attack run on a larger ship, or if ships are in attack mode, 
				  -- kinda near each other and no immediate threats in some range
				  -- player requests 'form on me'



Ambient Goals -- goal checks that run occasionally and might switch state / replace top priority goal
	Defend Something && patrol
	Patrol && keep formation
	Evade
	Avoid Obstacles
	Recover Collision
	Safety / Hide
	Resume Formation

am I about to collide?
am I recovering from a collision?
am I in danger? 
is it inside the area I am assigned to defend?
incoming warheads?
is there something kicking my ass?

Destroy Ship
	am I too close?
	can I use missiles / weapon selection
	can I coordinate with allies?
	would attacking put me in danger? do I care?
	is it big?
	should I strafe it?

	would attacking put me in a joust?
	am I already dogfighting?
	is it a fighter?
	am I in a good attack position?
	are my weapons effective?
	destroy or disable?
	mission critical?
	player?
	how many things are attacking? -- might limit # of attackers on player

	can I even get there?
	is it faster than me?
	is it healthier than me?
	is the area safe?
	am I low on ammo?
	are there friendlies near by?
	can I hit the afterburner
	should I kamakaze?
